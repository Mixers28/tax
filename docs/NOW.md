# NOW - Working Memory (WM)

> This file captures the current focus / sprint.
> It should always describe what we're doing right now.

<!-- SUMMARY_START -->
**Current Focus (auto-maintained by Agent):**
- Keep docs aligned to the handoffkit CLI workflow and SPEC.md authority.
- Validate the session start/end flow with the new agent prompts.
- Remove leftover extension artifacts and keep repo structure clean.
<!-- SUMMARY_END -->

---

## Current Objective

Deliver a coherent handoffkit CLI workflow template with accurate docs and SPEC.md as the source of truth.

---

## Active Branch

- `main`

---

## What We Are Working On Right Now

- [x] Replace MCP framing in docs with the persistent agent workflow source of truth.
- [x] Remove extension artifacts and legacy scripts.
- [ ] Verify session flow with the new CLI and role prompts.

---

## Next Small Deliverables

- A clear usage section for selecting and handing off to agents.
- A quick validation note or checklist for CLI behavior.

---

## Notes / Scratchpad

- MCP terminology is deprecated; the new design doc is `docs/PERSISTENT_AGENT_WORKFLOW.md`.
